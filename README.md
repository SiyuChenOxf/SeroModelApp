# SeroModelApp
###### This is to run a Rshiny app for serology model. Please download all files into one folder and locally run `app.R`.
###### This app includes two tabs: One serology point and Multiple serology points. The function of each tab is as follows:
* One serology point: using daily COVID19 death data and one serology point given the infection fatality ratio and seroreversion rate to infer the exposure level; The seroreversion rate estimated from England data (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.08.21249432v1) is 1/193 which could be a reference for other studies but it may vary because of different antibody assay.
* Multiple serology points: using daily COVID19 death data and multiple serology points to infer the exposure level as well as the infection fatality ratio and seroreversion rate
